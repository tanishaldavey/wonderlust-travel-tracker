## Abstract
**Technologies used:** _Vanilla JavaScript, jQuery, Mocha, Chia, Fetch API, SASS, Webpack_

Wonderlust travel tracker is an appication built using JavaScript. jQuery and SASS were used to dispaly items onto the DOM for a user to see, while vanilla JavaScript was used to build out the functionality. It is a single page application that utilizes the fetch API to `get`, `POST`, and `DELETE` data on a server. There is login functionality for both a user and an administrator to use. Users are able to view and book trips, while holding onto that data, while an admin is able to approve and deny trips for a user has requested.
